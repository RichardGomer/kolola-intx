        <h1>KOLOLA Interchange Demo</h1>
        <p>The HTML page demonstrates the use of the KOLOLA Interchange DOM interface (provided by the
            reference implementation using attributes from the form fields), in combination with the
            Interchange Bridge and Interchange Client to fill form fields when a KOLOLA activity is
            dropped on to the target.</p>
